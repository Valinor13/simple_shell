# SHELL

## This project is a recreation of the SHELL environment
## The variables used come
from a preconstructed list supplied by Holberton curriculum.

## Built using Linux 14.0.4

## General usage: The program takes input commands, reads them from the
/bin/ and turns them into tokens that then get returned back as
arguments. An example is the common argument "ls." The SHELL tokenizes
the input, then prints the files in the cuirent directory to standard
output.

## Build is in process. Any bugs can be reported to the below contacts
and would be appreciated. Your imput will earn you one
internet cookie.
