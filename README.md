# SHELL

#### This project is a recreation of the SHELL environment
#### The variables used come from a preconstructed list supplied by Holberton curriculum.

#### Built using the C programming language in the Linux Ubuntu 14.0.4 os.

#### General usage: The program takes input commands, reads them from the $PATH and turns them into tokens that then get returned back as arguments. An example is the common argument "ls." The SHELL tokenizes the input, then prints the files in the current directory to standard output.

#### Build is complete. Any bugs can be reported to the below contacts and would be appreciated.
